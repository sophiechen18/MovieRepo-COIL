# MovieRepo-COIL
This project will recommend a user a movie from a preexisting dataset. The user will enter a name of a movie, and the application will recommend 10 similar movies.

Our dataset is based off of this Google Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I2cA9epmp6rBMqdfNfr3T3rLIB3lSY54?usp=sharing#scrollTo=4oZOMXva3Ybk
